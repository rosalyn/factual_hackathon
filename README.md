=================

At Factual's first ever data hackathon in 2013, Rosalyn built a regex-search application that works similarly to a string search tool for reading online. She calls it the Regex Binoculars.

Sometimes you want to search for multiple things at once (example: matching both "party" and "parties"), or you want to search for a street address or email pattern. The regex binoculars allows this flexibility.

Basic Usage:
/ Opens up the tool; enter your search request
n Find the next match
N Find the previous match
[ENTER] Search for your regular expression
Q Quit/hide the tool
